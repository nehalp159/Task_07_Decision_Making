### 🔴 Advanced Reasoning Questions

11. **Who was the most improved player this year?**

      * ✅ **Answer:** Since there's no data from previous seasons, we can define "most improved" as the most efficient shooter. In that case, **Rich Mackenzie** is the most efficient, with a **shooting percentage of 100%**.
      * ✏️ **Reasoning:** Shooting percentage is calculated as (Goals / Shots) \* 100. A higher percentage indicates greater efficiency in converting shots to goals.

12. **If the coach wants the team to score 10% more next season, which 2 players should they focus on improving?**

      * ✅ **Answer:** To increase scoring, the coach could focus on **Ward Emma** and **Caramelli Joely**.
      * ✏️ **Reasoning:** These players take a high number of shots (77 and 46, respectively) but have shooting percentages that are not among the highest on the team (38.96% and 34.78%). A small improvement in their shooting accuracy could lead to a significant increase in goals.

13. **Should the team focus on offense or defense to win more games?**

      * ✅ **Answer:** A balanced approach is always best. However, the data shows the team has a total of **10 game-winning goals** and has **caused 153 turnovers**.
      * ✏️ **Reasoning:** The game-winning goals show offensive clutch performance, while the high number of caused turnovers indicates strong defensive plays that can create scoring opportunities. To make a definitive recommendation, we would need to compare these metrics against other teams in the league.

14. **Who is the most valuable player overall?**

      * ✅ **Answer:** Based on a comprehensive MVP score, **Vandiver Coco** is the most valuable player.
      * ✏️ **Reasoning:** An MVP score was calculated for each player based on a weighted combination of positive stats (goals, assists, ground balls, draw controls, caused turnovers) and negative stats (turnovers). This provides a holistic view of a player's overall contribution to the team.

15. **Which player shows the most potential for growth?**

      * ✅ **Answer:** **Adamson Olivia** shows great potential.
      * ✏️ **Reasoning:** Despite playing only 3 games, she has a very high points-per-game average of 5.33. This suggests that with more playing time, she could become a major contributor to the team's offense.
