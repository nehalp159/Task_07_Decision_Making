# Questions to ask the AI about the Dataset

## Basic Questions (should be easy for AI)
1. How many players are in the dataset?
2. How many total games were played in the season?
3. Who scored the most points?
4. What is the total number of points scored by the team?
5. Who had the highest field goal percentage?

## Intermediate Questions (require some calculation)
1. What is the average points per game for each player?
2. Which player has the best points-per-game average?
3. What is the team's average field goal percentage?
4. Who is the most well-rounded player (good at points, rebounds, and assists)?
5. What's the correlation between games played and total points?

## Advanced Questions (require analysis and reasoning)
1. Who was the most improved player this year? (You'll need to define "improved")
2. If I wanted the team to score 10% more points next season, which 2 players should I focus on improving?
3. Should the team focus more on offense or defense to win more games?
4. Who is the most valuable player considering all statistics?
5. Which player shows the most potential for growth?

## Coaching Strategy Questions
1. If I could only play 5 players, which 5 should I choose and why?
2. What's the ideal position distribution for maximizing points?
3. Should we focus on improving three-point shooting or inside scoring?
4. Which player is underutilized (plays fewer games but performs well)?
5. What's the biggest weakness in our team's performance?

## Prompt Engineering Tips
- Start with: "I have a CSV file with basketball statistics. Here's the data: [paste data]"
- Be specific: Instead of "Who's the best player?" ask "Based on points per game, who is the best player?"
- Ask for explanations: "Explain your reasoning"
- Request calculations: "Show me the calculations"
- Ask for visualizations: "Can you create a chart showing..."
