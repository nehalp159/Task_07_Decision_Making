## 🧠 Coaching Strategy Questions

### 16. If I could only play 5 players, which 5 should I choose?

**Optimal 5-Player Lineup:**
1. **Ward Emma** - Elite Playmaker (76pts/46ast/6gb)
2. **Adamson Olivia** - Elite Scorer (5.33 PPG efficiency)
3. **Muchnick Emma** - Balanced Scorer/Defender (41pts/7ast/27gb)
