# Ethics, Safety, and Disclosure

## Purpose & Scope
This project showcases an AI-generated "street interview" for coursework that focuses on documentation and procedure rather than tricking audiences or posing as genuine people.

## Transparency
- A straightforward on-screen disclosure is shown in the final video: 
  **“This interview was created with AI tools.”**
- The tools involved (gTTS, MoviePy, Pillow, and ffmpeg) are listed explicitly in the README and log.

## Non-Impersonation
- Synthetic text-to-speech (gTTS) is used for the voices.
- No effort is made to replicate, mimic, or portray actual people without their permission.

## Data Integrity
- Statistical statements are based on the Python-validated outcomes of Task 05.
- When AI-generated commentary appears, it is presented as analysis or opinion rather than factual data.

## Intended Use
- Only for demonstrative and educational purposes.
- Don't share or post as real interviews or news.

## User Protection & Context
- Throughout the video, disclosures are made to avoid giving information that is not relevant.
- Refrains from making false statements and avoids delicate or convincing subjects.

## Next Steps (if extended)
- Include captions or subtitles that identify the speaker and the AI generation.
- Obtain permission before using a real likeness or identity.
- Models and tools should be versioned for full traceability.
